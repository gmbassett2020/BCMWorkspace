The model does take the quality of the opponent into account THROUGH
its offensive and defensive model fits.  Lets look at Arizona State for
example.  Here are the model vs actual scores for ASU using the model's 
latest fit:

prob rnk winning_team        actual pred    rnk losing_team         actual pred
 71%  16 Arizona State           45 32.7,    19 Washington              42 26.5
 99%  16 Arizona State           52 52.3,   109 North Texas              7  6.0
 12%  16 Arizona State           19 27.7,     3 Nebraska                 0 41.3
 89%  16 Arizona State           48 38.9,    45 Oregon                  27 23.7

(where "pred" is the AVERAGE score the model predicts for that matchup).

The model finds offensive and defensive fits for each team which on the
average produce the best fit to the actual scores.  With the exception of
the number of points Nebraska scored, the actual vs model scores are
pretty close.  If we look at the average performance:

            Average points ASU was expected to score: 38
                               actual average points: 41

                   Average expected defensive points: 24
                             actual defensive points: 19

The fact that the model did not reproduce a low score for Nebraska
suggests that this was an unusual event (i.e. far from the average
behavior of the two teams).  When finding the offensive and defensive
fits, the model goes through several iterations of adjusting the
off/def for each game to match the score and then averaging the off/def of
each team.  Getting the model's Nebraska points against ASU closer to
zero would require raising ASU defense and/or lowering Nebraska's
offense.  The fitting does this to the extent that this is ALSO
consistent with their other games.

The model doesn't reward playing against patsies.  If a team plays a patsy
it must score a lot of points or drop.  It is how many points that are
scored that counts, not who wins.  For example:

prob rnk winning_team        actual pred    rnk losing_team         actual pred
 99%   3 Nebraska                55 47.2,    27 Michigan State          14 21.6
 78%   3 Nebraska                 0 41.3,    16 Arizona State           19 27.7
 99%   3 Nebraska                65 50.5,    59 Colorado State           9 14.7

When playing Michigan State and Colorado State, if Nebraska had not done
as well as they did the model would have lowered its off/def.

       Average points Nebraska was expected to score: 46
                               actual average points: 40

                   Average expected defensive points: 21
                             actual defensive points: 14

Actually, making this assumption at the beginning of the year is not such an
awful thing to do.  In 1996 my model picked 75% of the in the first 
five weeks of the season (when the assumption of last year's performance
has the largest effect).  This is the same percentage as for the entire
1996 season.  Last year, when I made an attempt at adjusting the initial
values to reflect changes from the previous season, the model picked 77%
in the first 5 weeks and 78% for then entire year.  Basically, it is not
that bad of an assumption.

This is precisely what my model is designed to do, once enough games have 
been played in the season (say about 5 weeks).  In the mean time I recommend
that you use the model prediction as a baseline to adjust according to
how you feel the teams have changed.

There is no completely unique way fit the model to the actual scores.  This
season I am now doing the fit three different ways.  The variation in
rank between these methods is what I list as the "uncertainty".

At the beginning of the season the uncertainty is high because the solution
depends strongly on the initial guess at the teams strengths.  As more
games are played the different methods tend to converge toward a common
solution, reducing the uncertainty.

I ran 10,000 games each for a range of offensive and defensive values and
constructed a table.  For any given game I look up in the table
under the offensive and defensive settings for the two teams and get the
average scores and probability of a win.  So it has the same result as
if I did run 10,000 games but all I have to do is retrieve from a table.

Good question.  Here is how my model predictions break down according
to model forecasted percentage brackets:

                 50-59%  60-69%  70-79%  80-89%  90-99%     all
total games:        449     547     747     685     703    3139
number right:       268     355     541     563     639    2374
number expected:  248.3   355.1   563.8   584.2   657.3  2416.4
expected %:        55.3    64.9    75.5    85.3    93.5    77.0
actual %:          59.7    64.9    72.4    82.2    90.9    75.6

For example, for games where my model forecast a 60-69% change of a
victory (547) it got the winner right 355 times.  The average expected
percentage was 64.9% (355.1 of 547) and the actual correct also was 64.9%.
Actually it is not a coincidence that the actual and expected
percentages are so close.  I have adjusted my forecasted percentages
(reducing the larger ones by about 5-6% and increasing the lower ones by
4%) so that the forecasted and actual percentages would be the same.

I thought that this was pretty impressive until I realized that I could
come up with another model that was 100% accurate: flip a coin.  Expected
correct is 50% and actual correct will also be 50% on average.  The 
difference is that the coin-flip model is totally useless.   That is 
why I gave my overall accuracy.  The better the model, the higher that will
be.  I would love to know what the absolute best percentage is.  If one
knew that, then one would have the ultimate model.  Since I lower my larger
percentage forecasts by about 5%, perhaps the actual average percentage
of favored team over underdog is around 80%.
