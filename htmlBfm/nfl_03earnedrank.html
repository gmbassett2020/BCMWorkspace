Rankings determined by subracting a teams wins (see "act w-l") by the average number of wins other teams would get (as simulated by the Bassett Football Model) if they played their schedule (see "sim w-l").

KEY:
    rnk - rank based on how may games the given team has won divided by
          the average number of wins other teams would get playing that
          schedule using the Bassett Football Model

      u - uncertainty in rank (e.g. u=1 would mean rank uncertain by
          approximately 1 place, u=** for uncertainty greater than 99 places)

    scr - Stephenson earned rank score: the actual wins of a team 
          subtracted by the average simulated wins of all teams if they 
          had played that team's schedule (as simulated by the model)

act w-l - actual win-loss record

sim w-l - simulated win-loss record of all teams if playing that schedule
