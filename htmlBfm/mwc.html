(Note that "rnk" above is Bassett Model power ranking for the current
week for Division IA & IAA combined, not the Stephenson Earned Rank below.)

This week's MWC Stephenson Rankings (Division IA only):

  82 13 -0.85   5.0-5.0   5.8-4.2  IA  MWC        San Diego State

KEY:
    rnk - rank based on how may games the given team has won divided by
          the average number of wins other teams would get playing that
          schedule using the Bassett Football Model

      u - uncertainty in rank (e.g. u=1 would mean rank uncertain by
          approximately 1 place, u=** for uncertainty greater than 
          99 places)

    scr - earned rank score: the actual wins of a team subtracted by the
          average simulated wins of all Div IA teams if they played that
          team's schedule

act w-l - actual win-loss record

sim w-l - simulated win-loss record of all teams if playing that
schedule
