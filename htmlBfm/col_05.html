<H3> Bassett Model rankings: </H3>
The <B>Stephenson Earned Rank</B> shows what a team has earned from its wins.  It ranks by how much better a given team's winning record is when compared against how all other teams would have faired if they had played the same schedule.  (Available after the 5th week in the season.)  The <B>Power Rankings</B> measure the strength of each team by how well they have played on average, going by point performance.  The <B>Current Model Power Rankings</B> are the best indicator of how well a team will play in the future.
